COVID-19 Visualization Projects

Hi all!

Here are the visualizations I created for my final three projects in my QSS 17 Data Visualization class surrounding COVID-19. We were given national survey data, national cases data, and global cases data on COVID-19. I have created three visualizations for this project, using each data source: "Offensive Language: Americans Saying 'Chinese Virus' over Coronavirus", "Cases of Coronavirus over Time by County", and "Countries Ranked by Confirmed Cases of COVID-19".

I hope this helps visualize some aspects of the current pandemic. 

Best,
Jordan



## Cases of Coronavirus over Time by County

This map visualizes the number of cumulative, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each United States county from January to May. Created in RStudio with ggplot and gganimate, using data from the New York Times. 

## Countries Ranked by Confirmed Cases of COVID-19

This animation ranks countries and the geographical regions of China by the number of cumulaitive, confirmed cases of COVID-19 over time. Created in RStudio with ggplot and gganimate, using data from the COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University

## Offensive Language: Americans Saying 'Chinese Virus' over Coronavirus

This graphic visualizes the usage of racist terminology across the United States, as well as the favorite news stations of these respondents. Created in RStudio with ggplot, using data from a PRRI April 2020 Coronavirus survey from the Roper Center.
