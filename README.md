# COVID-19-Data-Visualizations
COVID-19 Visualization Projects

Hi all!

Here are the visualizations I created for my final three projects in my QSS 17 Data Visualization class surrounding COVID-19. We were given national survey data, national cases data, and global cases data on COVID-19. I have created three visualizations for this project, using each data source: "Offensive Language: Americans Saying 'Chinese Virus' over Coronavirus", "Cases of Coronavirus over Time by County", and "Countries Ranked by Confirmed Cases of COVID-19". I hope this helps visualize some aspects of the current pandemic. 

# Sources
For "Offensive Language: Americans Saying 'Chinese Virus' over Coronavirus", I used source data from a PRRI April 2020 Coronavirus survey from the Roper Center (https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31117309). 

For "Cases of Coronavirus over Time by County", I used data from The New York Times, based on reports from state and local health agencies (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

For "Countries Ranked by Confirmed Cases of COVID-19", I used data from the COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
